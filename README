MultiAppRouting
================

The goal of the MultiAppRouting plugin is to allow easy linking between multiple rails applications on different hosts.

Installation
=======

script/plugin install git://github.com/jakehow/multi_app_routing.git

Example
=======

In routes.rb:

map.application(:billing, :protocol => 'https') do |billing|
  billing.resources :payments
end

In config/applications.yml:

production:
  billing:
    host: billing.yourdomain.com


In your code:

billing.payments_url => https://billing.yourdomain.com/payments


Notes
======

Options must be valid url_for options to do anything. See http://api.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActionController/Base.html#M000267

Options precedence is as follows:

billing.payments_url(:host=>'google.com) (in a view or controller)
overrides:
map.application(:billing, :host=>'yahoo.com') (in routes.rb)
overrides:
production:
  billing:
    host: billing.yourdomain.com
(in applications.yml)
